IBSI-2 CT radiomics phantom
===

This phantom is identical to the one used in phase II of IBSI 1. For details on use, please consult the IBSI reference manual.

The phantom is available in both DICOM and NIfTI formats, and consists of the image itself (image) and its segmentation (mask).
The segmentation in DICOM format is an RTSTRUCT and needs to be converted to a voxel mask, whereas in the NIfTI format, the mask is already a voxel mask.
Consider using the NIfTI mask in case conversion of in-plane polygons to a mask is not supported.
