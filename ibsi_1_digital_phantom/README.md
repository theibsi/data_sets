IBSI-1 digital phantom 
===

This phantom was designed to test computation of image biomarkers. For details on use,
please consult the IBSI reference manual.

The phantom is available in NIfTI format and consists of the image itself (image) and its segmentation (mask). The DICOM mask was deprecated due to incorrect image spacing.
