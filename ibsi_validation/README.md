IBSI validation dataset
===

This dataset is used to validate findings for the IBSI (in both Chapter 1 & 2). 
Feature extraction is performed on the `GTV_Mass` contour.

The phantom is available in both DICOM and NIfTI formats, and consists of the image itself (image) and its segmentation (mask).
The segmentation in DICOM format is an RTSTRUCT and needs to be converted to a voxel mask, whereas in the NIfTI format, the mask is already a voxel mask.
Consider using the NIfTI mask in case conversion of in-plane polygons to a mask is not supported.

## Acknowledgments
This dataset is based on the images and contours of the Soft-tissue-Sarcoma collection that was uploaded to the Cancer Imaging Archive.

Alex Zwanenburg:
* converted raw counts in PET images to SUV values.
* performed N4 bias field correction on T1weighted MR images.
* normalised the MR images based on subcutaneous fat intensities.
* isolated the `GTV_Mass` contour.
* cropped the image 5 cm around the contour.
* exported the image and contour to DICOM format.
* converted the image and the mask from DICOM and RTSTRUCT formats to NIfTI format.

The above operations were performed using MIRP (https://github.com/oncoray/mirp).
